# [Bing Photo of the Day](https://blogs.bing.com/search/2017-05/get-the-story-behind-the-bing-homepage-image) for [Plash](https://github.com/sindresorhus/Plash)

> Automatically get a new beautiful photo as your wallpaper every day

## Usage

- Select “Open URL…” in the Plash menu.
- Paste in `gracious-bartik-71ff4f.netlify.com` ~~`https://bing-photo-of-the-day.netlify.com`~~ and click “Open”.
- 👌🦄

You don't need to set the “Interval” preference in Plash as the website will refresh the image automatically every 6 hours.

## Deploy your own

*Keep in mind that the above URL is on a free plan and has limited resources. If you have the technical ability, I would recommend deploying your own instance. Netlify has a generous free plan. It takes less than a minute.*
